Hello. I am Chris Curl, Missy's dad. Thank you for joining us tonight to celebrate Missy and Alex taking their next step in life together.  One night when she was a baby, something was bothering her, and after an hour of trying to calm her, I lifted her up and asked her, "What seems to be the problem, Missy?". She has been "Missy" ever since! We could only hope that someday she would find someone who cares about her as much as we do, and Alex is that person. Alex is such a thoughful and caring young man ... for Mother's day one year, we went to the stables and visited the horses. For Christmas, Alex's gift to us was to take us all on a trail ride. Alex, we are so happy you are joining our family, and look forward to many more fun times with you and Missy. But no beating me at Bocce! Let's raise our glasses to Missy and Alex!
